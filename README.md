#HTML5 Form Validation
#Description
This is a result of one of the aspects of HTML5 validation process that I believe is missing. It is the fact that the form validation process each error/invalid one at a time. So if multiple errors occur then the first will be displayed and none other. I wanted to be able to aggregate all the errors and display them to the user all at once.
